@page math_tests Test design

The following tests were developed (location: tests/math/test):
- testing of the basic mathematical functions (test0.cpp); 
- testing of operations with 3D vectors (test1.cpp, test2_1.cpp, test4.cpp);
- testing of operations with 2D vectors (test1_0.cpp, test2_2.cpp);
- testing of operations with 2x2 matrices and 2D vectors (test3_1.cpp);
- testing of operations with 3x3 matrices and 3D vectors (test3_2.cpp);
- testing of operations with 3x3 rotation matrices (test3_2a.cpp);
- testing of operations with 4x3 matrices and 3D vectors (test3_3.cpp);
- testing of sorting array and binary search (MArray class) (test7.cpp);
- testing of dictionary (MDict class) (test8.cpp);
- testing of bounding sphere (BSphere3 class) (test_bsphere3.cpp);
- testing of CRC code calculation (CRC class) (test_crc.cpp);
- testing of polar coordinates usage (test_polar.cpp);
- testing of spline usage (Spline class) (test_spline.cpp).
- testing of Halton quasi generator (test_halton.cpp).

The all tests processed by the simple console application. After test 
compilation the test.bat should be called which prints SUCCESS/FAILURE as the 
result.
